# Video-Magnification_Computer-Vision
## Objective
Many seemingly static scenes contain subtle changes that are invisible to the naked human eye. However, it is possible to pull out these small changes from videos through the use of algorithms. Video magnification give a way to visualize these small changes by amplifying them and pull out interesting signals from these videos, such as the human pulse, sound from vibrating objects and the motion of hot air.
## Procedure
Developed a program to magnify the video by extracting the band pass components using Laplacian pyramid, followed by temporal filtering to the frames with Butterworth bandpass filter. The resulting signal is then amplified to reveal hidden information.
## Techniques
Eulerian Video Magnification, Laplacian Pyramid, and Butterworth bandpass filter
## Industrail Use
Contact less Hear rate monitoring, Hidden Sounds can be captured from objects.
